            <h1 class="title">Googling is an essential skill in life</h1>
            <h2 class="title">So here are some tips to help improve your efficiency with googling.</h2>

            <h3>The #1 tip I could give is to narrow down your search</h3>
            What I mean by this, is instead of posting your <b>ENTIRE</b> questions, only put the <b><u><i>important</i></u></b> words
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if I wanted to search for the bus communication name of the Wii, I wouldn't type into google
            "What is the name of the bus communcation of the Nintendo Wii". I would ask "Wii bus communication name". Narrowing down my search greatly.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is caused by how the searching algorithm for google works, basically, it takes the words you give it, removes the filler words, and spits out a result.
            If we can narrow down the words it needs to remove, aswell as the words it keeps, we can narrow down our search results
        </p>

            <div>
                <button onclick="toggle_FQ()" id="FQ">Full Question</button>
                <img src="" id="full_question" onclick="toggle_FQ()">
            </div>

            
            <div>
                <button onclick="toggle_nFQ()" id="nFQ">Without quotations:</button>
                <img src="" id="not_full_question" onclick="toggle_nFQ()">
            </div>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip2"> <!-- Tip #2 div -->
        <p>
            <h3>The #2 tip I could give is..</h3> 
            to use quotations ( "" ) around the word you want to find, this'll assure that the word you're looking for is in the web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many people do not realize how effectively simple this trick is, instead of searching through hundreds of webpages for a specific thing, 
            you can simply put the terms in quotations <code> ( " " ) </code> and it'll work out fine!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you need to find multiple words, you can attach quotations around each word, optionally also put a plus symbol ( + ) in there!
        </p>
