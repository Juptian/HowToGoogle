            to use quotations ( "" ) around the word you want to find, this'll assure that the word you're looking for is in the web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many people do not realize how effectively simple this trick is, instead of searching through hundreds of webpages for a specific thing, 
            you can simply put the terms in quotations <code> ( " " ) </code> and it'll work out fine!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you need to find multiple words, you can attach quotations around each word, optionally also put a plus symbol ( + ) in there!
